M(P) Bus Lines

All lines have 5V levels.

BCLK	Clock.  Bidirectional, idle high. Timing 20-30us per bit, 3-8ms between bytes
BDATA	Data.  Bidirectional, idle high. Data changes at clock negative edge. 8 bit, transmitted LS bit first
BRST	Reset. Unidirectional, idle high. Pulled low by head unit for about 0.5s at startup, before any
	other bus activity and again when power to head unit is off
BSRQ	Service request.  Unidirectional, idle high. Asserted at startup by peripherals (CD or tape) needing
	attention.  Then while a peripheral is playing may be asserted at 0.5 - 1 second intervals.  Head
	unit does not poll peripherals at startup so if SRQ not asserted will assume none are present.
BRXEN 	Receivers Enable.  Bidirectional, idle high. Pulled low by talker when sending each byte


Messages from / to head unit

First 2 bytes are message type and number of bytes in rest of message.  Thus each message is a minimum of 
2 bytes.

Type
 00	status when system off?
 01	head unit status?
 03	command to tape?
 06	command to CD
 21	command to dashboard
 60	status from CD (not playing)
 61	status from CD (playing)
 71	status from tuner

Status (01)
	01	Type
	03	always 3 bytes
	p1	bit 4 appears to be power flag: off=1
	0s	source: 0=off, 6=cd, 7=tuner
	00,02,04

to tape (03) 1st message in response to SRQ, probably to determine if there's a tape
	03	Type
	00	No more bytes

to CD (06) 1st message in response to SRQ, probably to determine if there's a cd
	06	Type
	00	No more bytes

to CD (06)
	06	Type
	01	always 1 byte
	cc	command: 00=statusreq, 06=play, 16=stop, 26=track+, 27=track-, 28=toggle random, 3d=change disc to d,
		f0=?, f6=? these 2 appear only at start up, ff=reset

to dashboard (21)
	21	Type
	08	always 8 bytes
	00
	0d	Display type: 0=normal, 1=cd selector, 2=bass, 3=treble, 4=balance, 5=fade, 6=volume
	vv	volume, hex 00-1E
	30
	00
	00
	00
	00	value

from CD (60) response to first message (06 00) and reset command (ff). Head unit will send reset at power off
	60	Type
	01	always 1 byte
	1c	bit 3 is cd magazine presence, bit 4 is acknowledge.  if b4=0 the head unit will reset again

from CD (60) response to status request (00) when not playing
	60	Type
	02	always 2 bytes
	0c	bit 3 is cd magazine presence
	ss	previous state of cd: 11=off, 12=no magazine, 00=playing

from CD (60) response to f0 command (only occurs at startup)
	60	Type
	03	always 3 bytes
	1c	bit 3 is cd magazine presence, bit 4 is acknowledge
	ss	previous state of cd: 11=off, 12=no magazine, 00=playing
	01	?, always the same

from CD (60) response to f6 command (only occurs at startup) if not playing, otherwise 61 response as below
	60	Type
	02	always 2 bytes
	1c	bit 3 is cd magazine presence, bit 4 is acknowledge
	ss	previous state of cd: 11=off, 12=no magazine, 00=playing

from CD (61) response to any command when playing
	61	Type
	0A	always 10 bytes
	ss      command status: 08 normally, 18 to acknowledge command (not status), 48 when changing track
	SS	State: 00=stopped, 01=paused, 02=reading disc, 03=changing track, 04=playing, 07=buffer filling, 11=changing disc
	Fd	d = disc number 1-6
	mm	Track time minutes, BCD.  FF if not relevant
	ss	Track time seconds, BCD.  FF if not relevant
	tt	Track number, 1-99, BCD.  FF if not relevant
	00
